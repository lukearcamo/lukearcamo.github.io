    A lot of these works are part of my worldbuilding, hence the two-part
    descriptions.

      title: Dunes
      date: March 2020
      lore: >-
        Many alien races arrived on Kayhauhu throughout the ages. Amid the
        multitudes, the species who owned this particular probe has long been
        forgotten.
      caption: >-
        I took up digital art during the pandemic, and this was one of the
        earlier works I did. This was a reworked version of an older painting; I
        significantly improved the sky, and I added texture to the sand.
    - filename: treasures_900na.png
      title: Treasures of Our Own
      date: April 2020
      lore: >-
        While they sought the treasures of our world, we found treasures from
        them. It's how we've survived for so long. We scavenge, we adapt.
      caption: >-
        This was also a reworked version of an older painting; I made the
        colours stronger, I added more interesting textures and shapes, and I
        gave the composition more movement.
    - filename: first_contact_800na.png
      title: Beyond The Hill
      date: June 2021
      lore: >-
        One of the first aliens to arrive on Kayhauhu were humans. Increased
        space activity around Kayhauhu attracted the attention of others who
        sought the resources that the pristine planet had to offer.
      caption: >-
        . This was a reworked version of my very first digital landscape
        painting. The sky remained largely intact, I only changed the grass with
        my new knowledge of special brushes, and I also made the horizon and the
        sky features slanted to make the composition more interesting.
    - filename: third_contact_reworked_800na.png
      title: Third Contact
      date: December 2019
      lore: >-
        When exactly the third species arrived is unclear; a plethora of
        calendars and unstable celestial conditions makes long-term timekeeping
        unreliable.
      caption: >-
        This was the second digital landscape painting I ever did. I boosted the
        contrast to hide the mistakes in the shadows 😔 but besides that, these
        clouds are one of the most unique ones I've made so far.
    - filename: fishless_reworked_800na.png
      title: Moribund Livelihood
      date: May 2020
      lore: >-
        The ǂiri are known for their countless failed experiments. In this
        abandoned laboratory, leaking fertilizer caused an algal bloom that
        poisoned the fish of nearby villages.
      caption: >-
        The three things that I was inspired to paint here were algae, water
        reflections, and rocks. I think the three primary colours worked really
        well together in this image.
    - filename: monument2_800na.png
      title: The Monument that Pierced Our Souls
      date: May 2020
      lore: >-
        The monument at Champs-Gyohri stands as a reminder of their failed
        collusion. It is said that the corrupted violet flowers grew after the
        battle from their spilled red and blue blood.
      caption: >-
        This was actually a reworked version of an older painting that I did. I
        modified the sky; sometimes its blank blueness is beautiful in itself.
    - filename: masked_reunion_800na.png
      title: Masked Reunion
      date: June 2020
      lore: >-
        After they pillaged a northern forest in search of emotion, the forest
        fell silent, until a ranger rediscovered the lost wildlife in new
        bodies.
      caption: >-
        This was the first time I actually painted foliage rather than using a
        fancy brush. Overall, a simple painting of silhouettes, but very
        atmospheric indeed.
    - filename: storms_reworked_800na.png
      title: Blue Storms and Crimson Waves
      date: June 2020
      lore: >-
        Hidden from Mah's familiar warmth, the last light seen by this coastal
        town was a foreign one.
      caption: >-
        I used a different brush for this painting, plus a lot more blending,
        hence it looks very soft and blurry. I honestly don't know if that's a
        good thing.

      title: Speak With A Coloured Tongue
      date: April 2021
      caption: >-
        This painting illustrates the ongoing resistance against language loss.
        The attempt to silence a language is thwarted by the act of removing the
        white tape, symbolizing defiance against assimilation.
    - filename: urbanization_postproc_800na.png
      title: False Opportunities
      date: May 2021
      caption: >-
        This painting illustrates the phenomenon of urbanization. Despite cities
        providing better opportunities at life for many people, they also
        present a different set of challenges, such as overpopulation,
        pollution, and loss of culture.
    - filename: assimilation_800na.png
      title: Ancestors Calling
      date: May 2021
      caption: >-
        This painting illustrates the process of cultural assimilation. As
        people transform themselves in order to integrate into contemporary
        society, it is important to never forget one's culture, traditions, and
        ancestry. Otherwise, a part of one's identity dies, forgotten by all but
        one's ancestors, lost in the depths of history.

        "I am Narcissus and my little zoom square is my lake" —@somfeelingood, Twitter
      caption: >-
        During one of my online classes, the
        natural lighting from my window was stunning so I painted my little
        thumbnail. I was particularly captivated by how my webcam omits details
        in extreme light and shadow.
    - filename: airpods_800na.png
      title: Meisje Met De Airpods
      date: January 2021
      caption: >-
        This was a recreation of the famous painting by Johannes Vermeer, my
        favourite painting of all time. I added airpods to make it creative and
        modern, but then <i>Google Images</i> shatters my dreams and shows me
        existing memes of this same idea. Nevertheless, this was my first
        digital portrait painting, which inspired me to paint more portraits.
    - filename: louise_800na.png
      title: Louise Speaks to General Shang
      date: December 2021
      caption: >-
        My favourite movie is the 2016 movie Arrival. I loved Villeneuve's sleek
        yet human visual interpretation of Ted Chiang's original short story, so
        it is fitting that I should do a movie study on this climactic scene. I
        hoped to capture Amy Adams' likeness and emotions, but the soft lighting
        made it difficult. These two are aspects I wish to practice more in my
        portraits.
    - filename: mariya_800na.png
      title: 竹内 まりや
      date: October 2021
      caption: >-
        Mariya Takeuchi's famous album covers, colorized. May her music and the
        impact of city pop never be forgotten. Again, experimenting with
        capturing likeness. The original reference was high-contrast, so some of
        the shadows and lights are a bit overblown. Nevertheless, I think I did
        well, along with the clothes and the hair.
    - filename: consumer_800na.png
      title: The Consumer
      date: September 2021
      caption: >-
        Experimented with halftone and sketching on a phone. Inspired by the
        artwork of Katerina Belikova (@ninjajo_art on Instagram). As always,
        hands are the artist's bane, so don't look too closely at them. As for
        this consumer, their bane is the lies & vanities fed by those above
        them.
    - filename: hunter_800na.png
      title: A Young Blö Hunter
      date: January 2021
      lore: >-
        It isn't clear what the Blö of Kumunuo Forest are; only hunters like
        this boy have seen their visible form using traditional drugs and
        cybernetics.
      caption: >-
        This was a character for a short story that currently only exists in my
        mind which I have yet to write. In this painting, I particularly like
        the fur coat, and the face paint pattern.
    - filename: council_800na.png
      title: The Council
      date: February 2021
      caption: >-
        I made this painting simply because I wanted to see the three most
        iconic internet dogs together: Cheems, Gabe, and Doge.

      title: Guild Navigator
      date: July 2022
      caption: >-
        My interpretation of a guild navigator from Dune. I wanted to somehow
        find a way to make a bloated fish-human elegant and not-gross. The
        answer was 'axolotls', and while I was at it I made the representatives
        futuristic-Aztec inspired as well.
    - filename: nomatter_800na.png
      title: No Matter What Happens
      date: May 2021
      lore: >-
        Many cities in Kayhauhu are inhabited by a mix of native, alien, and
        hybrid races. Sociopolitical division between races is prevalent, and
        danger befalls those who are not cautious.
      caption: >-
        This was a painting I made for Mother's Day, depicting a mother's
        unwaivering and protective love for her children.
    - filename: adapt_reworked_800na.png
      title: Adapt
      date: August 2020
      lore: >-
        For the natives of Kayhauhu, adaptation is necessary for survival. As a
        child, ʻNayé's parents died in a ǂiri raid. She had to give up her
        nomadic lifestyle and move to the city where she now sells scavenged
        electronics in her small shop.
      caption: >-
        This was the first time I ever used image textures on a painting. I
        think it added more detail which is nice, but it can be difficult
        finding the perfect texture for an object.
    - filename: gender_reveal_800na.png
      title: Was it Worth It?
      date: March 2021
      caption: >-
        This was supposed to be part of the Quiet Problems painting series
        above, but it didn't really fit so I separated it. This painting was
        inspired by the 2020 California wildfire caused by a gender reveal
        party. This was by far the fastest painting I've ever made, finishing in
        under 2 hours.
    - filename: noodles_postproc_800na.png
      title: Noodles
      date: July 2020
      caption: >-
        I had ramen at a friend's house and it looked nice so I painted it. I
        tried making it look "wet" using highlights but I didn't have a good
        enough understanding of light to make it realistic or accurate.
    - filename: shore_800na.png
      title: Where It Washed Ashore
      date: July 2020
      lore: >-
        Two days after Kahauafanurua went missing, he washed back ashore,
        unconscious and without memories. The next day, another arrived. As we
        later learned, one of them was not real; a mimic sent to steal the
        object that had protected our island for years.
      caption: >-
        For this piece, there was no inspiration other than a versatile bubbly
        watercolor brush that I found. Since then, I have used it for waves,
        foliage, and food.
    - filename: mountain_study_800na.png
      title: Untitled
      date: October 2020
      caption: >-
        This study was based on an older mountain acrylic painting I made a few
        years ago. Here, I used a more hard-edged untextured brush with very
        little blending, and I think it worked really well to convey the
        mountain's roughness.
    - filename: canal_800na.png
      title: Untitled
      date: June 2021
      caption: >-
        Yet another study to practice foliage and water, without using special
        brushes or hiding details in dark silhouettes. The technique I found
        when painting foliage was to keep adding finer and finer leaf details. I
        think it could be improved by spending more time adding details and
        reducing the amount of blending.
    - filename: train_900na.png
      title: Untitled
      date: July 2020
      caption: >-
        For this study, I wanted to try painting fields of grass, as well as
        green rounded hills, since most of the mountains I've painted are blue,
        distant, and rocky. I didn't think the composition was balanced so I
        added a person.
    - filename: waystone_postproc_800na.png
      title: Waystone
      date: May 2020
      caption: >-
        Another foliage study except I used special brushes :P. Not happy with
        the symmetrical composition and the overall darkness/solidness of the
        colour, but I do like the limited blending.
    - filename: spaces_lowres.png
      title: Spaces of Unnamed Emotions
      date: May 2020

        These studies of liminal spaces were inspired by my room during the
        pandemic, childhood memories, and images on the internet.
    - filename: envoi_site.png
      title: Envoi
      date: June 2021
      caption: >-
        My first attempt at a comic strip, which was for a school project.
        This is my interpretation of the last chapter in The Penelopiad by
        Margaret Atwood.
