For this study, I wanted to try painting fields of grass, as well as green rounded hills, since most of the mountains I've painted are blue, distant, and rocky. I added a person to balance the composition, but I don't think it added much.

Comment 2024-07-03: Looking back, I noticed most of my landscapes had little people. I think this was to add a grand sense of scale, or because I wasn't confident it could stand alone. I appreciate the effort to add story, but I wouldn't do it today. It's nice to see how far I've grown as an artist.
