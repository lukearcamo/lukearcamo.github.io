> *"What if the experience of knowing the future changed a person? What if it evoked a sense of urgency, a sense of obligation to act precisely as she knew she would?"* ---Ted Chiang, Story of Your Life

One of my all-time favourite movies is Arrival (2016). I loved Villeneuve's visual interpretation of the original sci-fi short story. I hoped to capture Amy Adams' likeness and emotions, but the soft lighting made it difficult. These are aspects I wish to practice more in my portraits.
