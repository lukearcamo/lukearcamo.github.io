"Quiet Problems" is a series of artworks intended to raise awareness about global issues that are often overlooked. This is the first of three, created for an Asian Heritage Month high school presentation.

This painting illustrates the ongoing fight against language loss. Removing the white tape is an act of defiance against monolingualism/language attrition, and a commitment to the preservation of linguistic diversity.Fi
