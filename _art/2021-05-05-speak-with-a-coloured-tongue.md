"Quiet Problems" is a series artworks intended to raise awareness about global issues that are often overlooked. This is the first of three, created for an Asian Heritage Month school presentation.

This painting illustrates the ongoing resistance against language loss. Removing the white tape is an act of defiance against assimilation and a commitment to the preservation of linguistic diversity.
