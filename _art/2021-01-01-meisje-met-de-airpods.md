This was a recreation of the famous painting by Johannes Vermeer, one the greatest influences on my personal style. I added airpods to make it creative and modern, but apparently memes already exist of this idea on Google Images. Regardless, this was my first digital portrait painting and I enjoyed it enough to make more.
