This was a recreation of the famous painting by Johannes Vermeer, my favourite painting of all time. I added airpods to make it creative and modern, but then *Google Images* shatters my dreams and shows me existing memes of this same idea. Nevertheless, this was my first digital portrait painting, and it inspired me to make more.
