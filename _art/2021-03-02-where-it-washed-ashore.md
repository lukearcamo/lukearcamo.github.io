> *Two days after Kahauafanurua went missing, his body washed back ashore without memories. The next day, another body arrived. The village was welcoming, but some were rightfully distrustful. One was a mimic, and we weren't supposed to find the other.*

For this piece, there was no other inspiration but a foamy watercolor brush that I discovered. Since then, I have used it for foliage, food, and other textures.
