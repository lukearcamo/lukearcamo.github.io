★★★★☆ — A semi-autobiographical story of Japanese internment in Canada. During WWII, Canadian citizens of Japanese descent were dubbed a national security threat by the government and forced to relocate into abhorrent living conditions. This is the story of a girl and the horrors her family quietly endured — a family, once whole, fragmented by the end.

<!--split-->

## 1. Worldbuilding
* Contemplative, Pastoral, Mono no aware (the recognition of the transience of everything in life)
  * Could be a Studio Ghibli film if it weren’t so dark. Actually, a movie adaptation would be so good.
* World seen through childlike eyes
  * The reader grows in understanding and maturity along with her.
  * The author was not concerned about describing the technical details about the way internment was run, like the textbooks I used to read for history class. Though it would give a clearer and bigger picture of this historical event, it is not as emotional as actually describing the experience from the perspective of a person.
* Grounded in historical accuracy.
  * The Canadian government’s atrocities are covered up by their contemporary image of multiculturalism. I feel like this particular Canadian historical event is often overlooked by many people.
    * Not only was the event bad, but the damage control afterwards (forced exile as a supposed given opportunity) was negative IQ too.
    * And to have the towns and buildings erased afterwards, to have your whole life and the physical evidence of injustice erased must be eerie.
  * I read a review complaining that Atwood’s Gilead takeover was too quiet, too simple. But of course, there is always historical precedent: this, for instance.
* The gruesome descriptions near the end evoked hell, animated yet so full of death. Before reading it, it never occurred to me how horrific that particular experience must have been (I won’t spoil what it is because, though in hindsight it is obvious what could have possibly happened, it still caught me by surprise; I was too focused on one horror to think of the other)
* By the end of the book, it is striking looking back at how the family was described in the beginning, compared to how broken it is now.

## 2. Writing style

### 2.1. Format, Medium, Structure
* Epistolary, Frame story, Circular story
* Almost biographical
* The firm, legal, accusatory tone of the note at the end, though dry in other contexts, added respite from the heart wrenching suffering, clarity regarding the past, and hope regarding the future.
* The first step to resolution is acknowledgement. It made me feel inspired to take action, vengeful yet rational, like Aunt Emily and her perseverance.

### 2.2. Imagery, Description, Poetry
* The author has the voice of Margaret Atwood but with much longer and more intricate metaphors and imagery.
* Like *The Joy Luck Club*, it is satisfying to see motifs referenced later on, suddenly making sense.
  * She is able to draw meaningful lessons from mundane objects like dolls, flutes, brambles, nursery rhymes, etc.
* Moments of stream of consciousness, or random childish thoughts. A wide dynamic range demonstrates the author’s writing skill.
* She knows how to show and feel, rather than tell. I felt their emotional pain and physical discomfort, separated from people, toiling on the fields.
* In writing, I have learned that philosophical thoughts do not have to be long profound debates. They can be brief shallow bursts inspired by surroundings. This is how to avoid sounding didactic.
  * e.g. As Nomura-obasan watches Stephen limping, hoping for a speedy recovery, she relates to their situation with a positive outlook: “Together, with strength, with energy, let us walk.”
* The non-intrusive way she conveys bilingual dialogue is something that I will use for my own writing, probably if there is a conlang: first the foreign language, followed by the English translation e.g. “Kodomo no tame–for the sake of the children.”

## 3. Characters, Dialogue
* No flat characters. All had such unique personalities, appearances, speech, and developments over time. For example:
  * Aunt Emily was not simply a bystander who ran away to Toronto; she took a hit as well when she was still in Vancouver.
  * Stephen had some pent-up trauma, visible near the end.
  * Dad stuck flowers onto his pickaxe to remember them. Such a brief description of a tiny gesture demonstrating love unbounded by distance.
* The family tree was a bit hard to keep track of at times. Easily fixed by a supplementary diagram at the beginning or end of the book.
* A central theme is the love between mother and child. I won’t spoil it, but there was an ultimate sacrifice, invisible at first, which resembles that of Estraven for Genly in [*The Left Hand of Darkness*]({% post_url 2022-10-10-the-left-hand-of-darkness-ursula-k-leguin %}): loving someone so much that you must separate yourself from them to protect them.
