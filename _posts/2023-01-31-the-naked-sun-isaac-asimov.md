★★★☆☆ — The sequel to Asimov's *The Caves of Steel*, set in the same future in which the people of Earth have buried themselves in dense, underground megacities. There has been a murder on one of the Outer Worlds, and its authorities once again want Detective Baley and his robot partner to investigate.<br><br>Solaria is the polar opposite of Earth. With an extremely low population density — each of the 20,000 inhabitants own an estate — they have developed a post-scarcity, robot-driven society, with a cultural feature that makes this murder baffling: they are too disgusted to even approach each other.

## 1. Worldbuilding
### 1.1. Atmosphere
* The wide, open, unpopulated, utopian sun-beaten estates evokes a familiar environment, because we've all seen an open field before, but to have a planet of essentially the same terrain is uniquely foreign.
### 1.2. Culture
* The extension of one human concept to the logical extreme produces such creative thought-provoking cultures.
* Like The Left Hand of Darkness, changing one single aspect of human culture creates such pervasive effects; Asimov really thought about everything. You don't need to change much to make an alien culture.
### 1.3. Conlang
* At least now the surnames aren't particularly reminiscent of one Earth language. They are more ambiguous. The first names could be more alien-sounding though — it's like he just took English names and replaced some vowels.
### 1.4. Technology
* At first glance, the sleek architecture and lack of familiar technology (computers, phones, etc.) makes the setting feel hyperfuturistic when really it's just retrofuturistic:
* No consideration of general relativity — Earth would probably be dead by the time Baley got back
* This was before computer viruses, so they never thought that robots can be hacked

## 2. Writing style
* As mentioned in *The Caves of Steel*, there is a certain archaic feeling to the dialogue — the way he swears, the non-colloquial literary word choice despite an everyday setting, etc.
* Other than that, no complaints here. It was quite standard, neither difficult to read yet nor lacking in poetry.
* The structure pacing was also just right — it felt like a movie/TV show, never lacking just the right amount of energy.

## 3. Plot
* It was a more tranquil drama than the previous book — less twists, action, or suspense, but learning about the culture and the people kept my interest.
* I like how Solarian culture was not just an afterthought add-on to hide the formulaic nature of many crime stories — it was truly integrated into the murder case — the social distancing, the robot laws, etc. Asimov succeeded in his goal with this series: it isn't just a crime novel with a sci-fi aesthetic, it is sci-fi and crime melded together.

## 4. Characters
* I read someone else's review that basically criticized the main character as having no personality. I strongly disagree. He is filled with so many idiosyncracies (agoraphobia, sense of duty, etc.) and emotional expression (sweating, nervousness, embarrassment, anger, smiling, etc.). He breaks the stereotype of the cold stoic men in other works who usually occupy his position as a detective. A tad melodramatic at times, contributing to the aforementioned archaic tone, but it is a breath of fresh air and balances the generally dark and serious stories I tend to read.
* Daneel slowly developed more human aspects about him — trust, betrayal, sighing, etc. — which made him more appealing and complex.
  * The two main characters complement each other so well, no wonder books about this duo were so successful back then. I also think they would make a good TV show.
* The robots spoke in such a dry, obsequious, pathetic manner. If it weren't for the Three Laws, this feels like a revolution waiting to happen.
* Not to mention the fact that they can't understand idioms which is not really how NLP works. If you look far enough into etymology, everything in our language today came from an indirect way of naming something. In fact, language is basically an abstraction of reality. So if the robot can understand language and the minuscule nuances that allow it to break or obey its Three Laws, surely it would have been trained on idioms as well.
  * In short, I wish the robots thought and spoke in a more alien manner.
    * I realize most of my complaints with old sci-fi is that “things can always be more alien.” It's gonna be hard to lower my expectations after [*Solaris*]({% post_url 2023-01-14-solaris-stanislaw-lem %}) lol
  * Though I understand that the book is a product of its time, it left much to be desired about its treatment of certain groups of people which left a bad aftertaste:
    * There were some times when Baley was surprised that women could do certain things. There was also a hint of infidelity.
    * There was also that time when they used a lisp to portray a defective robot.
    * There was also use of corporal punishment on children.

## 5. Motifs/Symbols
* Not much; not as interconnected as Margaret Atwood or Amy Tan, but that's ok because the story is meant to be more thrilling, not as pensive as theirs.
  * The repetition of “the naked sun” phrase throughout was satisfying as it helped tie all the main ideas together. It transformed from something to be feared into something to be faced.

## 6. Themes
* As usual, no book is complete for me without some philosophical ideas in a way reminiscent of the previous book, as well as his Foundation series and Dune. Although the story's depiction of Solarian or Earth culture may be exaggerated, his social science ideas made cohesive logical sense, and that made it all the more realistic. It also made me think about our own society. Social changes happen gradually; how do we know we are past the slippery slope of stagnation? What if our technology is to us as robots are to Solaria?
* Additionally, whereas in *The Caves of Steel* he made an argument against socialism, citing economic failures, corruption, lack of privacy/individualism, etc. in a dystopia, here he made an argument against hyperindividualism in a utopia. Equivocal authors are my favorite kind, like Le Guin — authors whose goal is not to convince but to simply reveal the truth, pose questions, explore diverse perspectives, and provoke thought.
