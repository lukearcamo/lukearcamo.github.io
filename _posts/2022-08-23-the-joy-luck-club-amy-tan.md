★★★★☆ — Written in 1989, this novel tells the story of four mothers and four daughters. As they gather around a mahjong table, they share their experiences immigrating from China to America, facing cultural pressure from both sides, and ultimately reconciling their difficult relationships. Though groundbreaking at the time, it has developed a bitter taste for many Asians today. Although problematic, here is an attempt at defending it, as I firmly believe that all books have at least some value or truth. If I had infinite lives, I'd read every book.

## 1. Thoughts

* It is incredibly satisfying to see seemingly insignificant details become surprisingly important poetic motifs later on. One of my favourite chapters is the perfect example of this: Lena St. Clair - The Voice from the Wall
* Ambiguous turbulent emotions, interconnected stories

### Contrary to many other people's views: <!-- omit from toc -->
* I did not find the portrayal of China as backwards. Seriously, if you want a backwards description of China just read a history textbook about Mao's era.
* I did not find that Asian men were portrayed largely in a negative light. First of all, there weren't even many of them so I agree it is biased in this way. Some of the ones that were clearly bad, like Wu Tsing, are not entirely representative of Chinese culture because they're Westernized. In other cases, the women had fathers that cared about them, but this was biased because they tended to only be background characters so I do agree that they could have been developed further.
* The folk tales did not feel carelessly interchangeable with CJKV culture. I think it would be more unfitting if only the popular Confuscian folk tales were mentioned.
  * First of all, China is a big place and, like in other parts of the world, folk tales can vary throughout the country, even from town to town. Individual experiences vary, and unless you did comprehensive research, you cannot really definitively say that a folktale is fake. But what do I know, maybe they are fake.
  * Secondly, a defining feature of oral traditions is that they tend to change stories dynamically to the point of unrecognizability; a game of broken telephone is a common analogy.
  * Lastly, often folk tales can also be spontaneously made up by individuals, rather than passed down. After all, even the oldest folk tales haven't always existed. Personally I remember stories when I was younger which I thought were folk tales or superstitions from my culture, but were simply bedtime stories told to make us behave, or gossip I overheard and misunderstood.
* Should Chinese culture be considered to be portrayed negatively in the book, it wasn't alone: American culture was portrayed with many of its own negative stereotypes as well.
* Nevertheless, I can see why many Asians today are upset that the book formed a distorted perception of them among Americans. Perhaps slapping "A New York Times bestseller" onto a cover does not exactly attract the most critical of thinkers. In the end, this isn't a reference book on Chinese culture. I guess I derived value from the book in its storytelling aspects than the accuracy of its cultural depictions.
