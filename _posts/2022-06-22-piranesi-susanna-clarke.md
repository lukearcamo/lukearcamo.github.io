★★★★☆ — The House is all that Piranesi has ever known. As its lone inhabitant, he is intimately familiar with its stone statues, the skeletons, the gift of wildlife, the pattern of tides, the layout of walls. He has only ever met The Other, a mysterious man who trades resources for his knowledge. But someone else is leaving messaages for him around the house. And as he explores deeper into the house, Piranesi pieces together how his place in his world came to be.

## 1. Thoughts

* Creative setting, like the architecture of antiquity, the aesthetics of Borges, or the timeless liminal spaces and backrooms of internet lore.
* Piranesi’s understanding of the structure and inner-workings of the House gave it a sense of technical realism
* Piranesi’s childlike wonder was cute (talking to birds/statues, thought processes, letters to 16, new shoes, trust in the Other, idealism)
* The crime mystery intertwined within the story added further interest
* Piranesi’s longing to return to the house embodies a kind of homesickness/nostalgia that does exist in the real world and which I have experienced – Despite having all the amenities and friends of the Other World, the House will always hold a special place in his heart.
* I know some people were disappointed after hearing overwhelmingly positive reviews. Sure, it's not groundbreaking, but it's certainly good.
* I don't often read contemporary novels because I feel like today's bookshelves are so saturated with realism, drama/romance, heavy-handed social commentary, and overall lack of imaginative worldbuilding. After all, if a classic remains relevant for so long, it's probably good. Nevertheless, I was pleasantly surprised to find a modern-day author whose work matches that of the old masters. In the future, I would definitely love to read her debut, *Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell*.
