★★★☆☆ — *The Hunt for Red October* is Tom Clancy's bestselling debut novel, and today remains the gold standard for spy novels, technothrillers, and military fiction. The book describes one of the most ingenious, convincing espionage plots ever created, set during the Cold War. The plan: to steal a whole submarine, quietly.

<!--split-->

## 1. Worldbuilding

### 1.1. Atmosphere, Culture
* Surprisingly optimistic for such a serious situation
  * Nice, but I somewhat miss the poignancy and subtle hopelessness of the SCP universe which also partly has a military theme
* I can sense the bias, describing the Soviet Union (its structure, culture, people, thought processes) from an American perspective.
  * For example, many Soviets were consistently portrayed as incompetent, and the streets of America were portrayed like a utopia.
  * There were other brief ideas in the book that I did not like, but it was hard for me to separate the author’s opinions from the fictional characters’ opinions.
* In spite of this I did not find myself having a negative value judgement of this work. I feel like it has value because of its bias, as long as I balance it with other works in the future that offer alternative perspectives.
  * I would describe myself like an anthropologist, an outsider observing the breadth of human culture yet not participating in all of it.
* The accuracy with which he describes US government operations highlighted countless micro-injustices that occur. I cannot tell whether he meant to highlight it, but seeing this perspective showed me. Behind the facade of bureaucratic order I saw traces of careerism, preferential treatment, autocratic decision making without complete democracy. Though I dislike these injustices, that’s not to say it has no justification. Perhaps it is more efficient to have centralized decision-making as in the Roman Republic, especially in delicate time-sensitive situations. Perhaps, as Frank Herbert taught, it is in human nature for followers to elevate leaders to consolidate concentrated power.
  * Another injustice mentioned in passing was the guy who had a relationship with his secretary, but that power imbalance: ew.
    * And with another girl he also had zero (0) rizz like “who do u work for” followed by “are u single” without batting an eye, like wow you are down abysmal

### 1.2. Technology
* Clancy did insane amounts of research for this, like not only were the military operations accurate (or so it seems), but also the science e.g. Fourier transform, pressure. I can see why this is classified as part of the techno-thriller genre.

## 2. Writing style

### 2.1. Format, Medium, Structure
* Like Roadside Picnic, the chapters are too long and not digestible. I can never find a good place to pause reading.
* On the other hand, the continuous flow, the cliffhangers, and hiding certain information from the reader helped maintain an engaging sense of tension.
  * For the longest time the plan was secret, all that was shown was the president saying Yes, but as more events took place, the plan started to become clear. Satisfying.
* Although I had zero background on submarines, politics, and normal naval operations, the author was able to communicate that so much protocol/routine/norms was being broken. He made me feel the tension, which overpowered what would have otherwise been an ocean of boring exposition.

### 2.2. Imagery, Description, Poetry
* Minimal beauty in language. Extremely focused on technical details, occasional vernacular language.
* Understandably this is not everyone’s taste. And it didn’t seem to be mine either, however I walked into it with an understanding from prior research that the book would be filled with this type of content, hence I was able to tolerate it. Note: see Overall below.

### 2.3. Word choice
* It’s always nice to learn new technical terminology (e.g. aft), and also slang terms. I like to be reminded of the vastness of the universe, the breadth of the human experience, and how much I don’t know.

## 3. Plot
* The author repeatedly adds hurdles and narrow wins, which keeps the reader on their toes. I can see why the book was so popular simply by its entertainment value.

## 4. Characters, Dialogue
* Moderately diverse cast e.g. disabilities, neurodivergence (Jones fs 100%)
* Not enough impactful representation of women
* THE NAMES OMG – The human mouth can produce so many amazing sounds, and there are 26 beautiful letters in the English alphabet. SO WHY ARE YOU STICKING TO THE MOST CONFUSING VANILLA NAMES you’re telling me to keep track of Jack, John, James, Jones, as separate people? like PLEASE im not even asking for “Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam” or “Kahguyaht”, like give me an “Edward” or a “Nicholas”
  * and the way the book freely switches between Jack and Ryan to refer to the same person. tha audacity i can’t

## 5. Themes
* I came for its supposed entertainment value, but was pleasantly surprised to find bite-sized bits of wisdom. Not as profound as my previous books, but still valuable.
  * “The likelihood of a secret’s being blown is proportional to the square of the number of people who’re in on it.” lol trueee
  * “One must know something of the truth in order to lie convincingly.”

## 6. Overall
* The realization above about people’s taste occurred from a discussion with a friend. The books that I don’t like tend to be the ones that fail to meet my initial expectations, whether about worldbuilding, writing style, structure, etc. in the same way they didn’t like The Left Hand of Darkness, one of my favourite books because of a failed expectation they had.
* Because honestly, I don’t like to hate things. As I see it, it takes more effort to hate something than to tolerate it. Life is more pleasant if I'm surrounded by things I like. Perhaps this is the reason why most of the books on this page are highly rated.
* Overall, I don’t stan this book, but it was surprisingly good.
