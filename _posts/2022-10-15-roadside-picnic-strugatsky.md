★★★☆☆ — Red Schuhart is a stalker, an illegal scavenger of the Zone. Several years ago, alien visitors left impossible artifacts. These physics-defying objects are protected by a research organization yet coveted by the black market in which Red sells. He risks death and imprisonment in order to support his family, trying to make a living in a universe that no longer makes sense. So, in this bleak the life of unpredictability and hopelessness, when he hears about an artifact that grants wishes, it's not hard to see that he's willing to do whatever it takes to find it.

## 1. Plot
* Captured the main character's slow descent into madness
* Unfortunately, because the chapters were so long, it was hard to identify important plot points
  * The long chapters also made it hard to start and stop reading. There were no clear breakpoints, so often I had to break it at a point that I didn't realize was important, and it ended up being hard to get back into the flow later.
  * Another thing that was confusing was the shifts in perspective and time between chapters. The only hint that I got of these changes were the titles of the chapters, which did not really stand out. Noonan's chapter did at least provide an interesting outsider perspective of Red and his enemies.

## 2. Writing Style
* The imagery, the descriptions of the things from the Zone were great. Surreal yet rugged.
* The grim depressing atmosphere was visceral. It reminds me of I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream, but whereas that was more physical pain, this was more psychological pain. Well done.
* Honestly the fact that there was so much vernacular language is impressive. If this from the original Russian, the Strugatskys did a great job capturing this feel in a language that, according to the afterword, did not really have this kind of speech before this book was written. And if this was after the translation, the translator did a great job interpreting the feel that the authors were going for and implanting it into English; it really fits in smoothly.

## 3. Characters
* Sometimes it's hard to argue with Red's worldview when you consider the horrible environment around him. Superficially he has a disagreeable character, but because we can hear his thoughts he is easier to sympathize and pity.
* What made Red's speech near the end so realistic and powerful was that he actually partly made sense; he was not rambling nonsense. Well, perhaps as a standalone speech it would be nonsense, but because we have prior context from the rest of the book, and because the Zone is already so irrational, the reader can sympathize with his chaotic and broken emotional state at this point. Additionally, he was discussing an aspect of his character (his principles and his independence), something personal and hence indisputable, as opposed to some profound universal revelation which another author might have placed in this ultimate, emotional scene, which would have ended up sounding fake or melodramatic.
* Aside from the length of chapters, the other thing I would change is the treatment of women. The Vulture was gross, Noonan was gross in those two moments with the Madam and the Monkey. Redrick seemed ok at first because he actually cared about Guta, but when he was with Noonan he really treated Guta like a servant. This is the one thing about his character that I do not agree with; you can be depressed and still treat women better than that; the Zone gives you no excuse to act this way.

Overall, this book is understandably a classic; I can see its influence and resemblance in a lot of other artworks and popular culture.
