## I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream by Harlan Elison
### August 20, 2022 | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜† <!-- omit from toc -->
Regarding the titular short story:
* One word: Pain.
* The ending's immense sacrifice, followed by a vague sense of smug, content nihilism and continued internal
* defiance against the AI when all hope seems lost was powerful.
* Intertextuality: Reminds me of [this series from the SCP wiki](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/like-clockwork-hub). Would not recommend reading these two back-to-back like I did.
* A bit hard to visualize the environment or the characters, but it felt surreal like in Waiting for Godot.
* The ending felt a bit too easy â€” how did AM not react fast enough?
Regarding the anthology as a whole:
* Psychedelic, Disorienting â€” Vivid but sometimes difficult to follow sudden shifts in POV.
* Skillful with use of language â€” Polysyndeton and compounding of adjectives adds to the vivid imagery, incorporating all senses not just vision. Occasional strange sentence structure, difficult to understand at first but eventually makes sense for its efficiency.
* Philosophical themes
* something something [death of the author](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfTheAuthor), pls dont cancel ðŸ™‚

## Cathedral (short story collection) by Raymond Carver
### June 24, 2022 | â˜…â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜† <!-- omit from toc -->
* I couldn't finish it after the first three stories.
* Tries to be purely emotional, with a lack of worldbuilding, leading to it feeling shallow, dry, unimpactful, unimaginative
* It didn't feel like it was trying to tell me anything. The dialogue feels dry and lacks meaningful information.
* No beautiful poetic sentences. The narration's particular flavour of colloquial language is ill-suited to the melancholic or profound atmosphere it aims for.
* Even though I enjoy minimalism, it's only good in moderation. Too much of it makes for a bland piece.

## The Green Hills of Earth by Robert A. Heinlein
### August 23, 2022 | â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜†â˜† <!-- omit from toc -->
* A taste of the Golden Age of sci-fi rather than the New Wave I prefer and am accustomed to.
* Wholesome poignancy
* High verisimilitude; unique biographical article format
* New Wave aspects begin to show through, like a greater focus on the human aspect rather than the fantastical science, though technical jargon was still present.
* From my modern scientific perspective their science looks quaint e.g. he was belittling the jungle terraformation of Venus, little did he know how immense of an achievement that would be in reality.
* Nostalgia/homesickness is relatable
* It's interesting to note how the the dangers in sci-fi stories reflect contemporary technology. Back when nuclear bombs were new, radiation was the greatest mysterious threat. Now with the cyberpunk genre, issues related to AI, lack of privacy, capitalism and corruption are top of mind.
