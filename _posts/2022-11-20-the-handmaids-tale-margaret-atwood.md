★★★★☆ — Red dress, white bonnet. Like yesterday. Today is grocery day. Offred provides the appropriate greeting to Ofglen. They walk down the street two-by-two. They read pictures, not words. They pass the guards at the checkpoint. They walk back. Offred returns to the Commander's house to take a long bath, because tonight is the Ceremony, and if she's lucky she will produce a viable child.<br><br>
Offred wasn't always a Handmaid for the Republic of Gilead. She remembers having books, a credit card, a job, a car. Family and friends. But everything's fine now, Aunt Lydia says, because women are protected and valued. Right?

## 1. Thoughts

* Plot — Atwood manages to make a humdrum life interesting, partly thanks to the rich worldbuilding
* Worldbuilding — The fact that she based a lot of this on real-world historical precedents is what makes the worldbuilding feel realisting and rich, just like Le Guin in LHOD
* Characters — The fact that Offred was caught in a multi-podal sociopolitical structure (unstable, as the Reverend Mother would say) demonstrates nuances in each character: the Commander at Jezebels, Serena Joy's desire for a baby, Ofglen and Mayday, and Offred's personal desire for Nick. As unlikeable some of them may be, each of their motives are realistic. Often the issue lies in their means not necessarily their ends.
* [One review](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/00/03/26/specials/mccarthy-atwood.html) criticized Atwood's dystopia by its lack of any form of Newspeak. As a worldbuilder, I can sympathize with the desire for further immersion, richer culture. Yet I can speak for the other side as well.
  * Firstly, much of the story lies within Offred's thoughts, where she is not obliged to use the filtered language imposed on her. And on the rare chance outside that women may speak, she indeed takes care; “Praise be,” she recites repeatedly and automatically, like a prayer machine.
  * Secondly, the revolution only happened a few years ago; such a culture would take time to develop, or at least get used to even if it were imposed. People are still not believers, but fearful. And their fear of the Eyes does not apply in the private situations of Offred's relationships.
  * Nevertheless, as I have read Atwood's other works, and I do agree with the review in that it seems like Offred is speaking with Atwood's voice; not much dexterity or dynamic range in terms of colloquial or poetic language.
* Other people criticize the realism of such a coup happen so readily and quickly. They cannot suspend their disbelief.
  * The coup supposedly happens in the 80s, but the point of divergence could be earlier. Perhaps there is a cultural foundation of indifference, or fundamentalism, or maybe the feminist movement wasn't as strong in this universe. The point is not to describe the details of how the regime came to be, but rather the regime's current functioning. That is why Atwood insists that this book be labelled "speculative fiction" rather than "science fiction". She's not being pedantic. *The Handmaid's Tale* is a looking-glass for society. The book doesn't ask how it was made or how to walk through it; that is the job of sci-fi.
    * Also it's not sci-fi because the book in fact lacks any kind of science or new technology. It strictly focuses on social themes.
* Themes & Motifs
  * Atwood touches upon a variety of social issues related to religion, gender, and the way she presents balanced perspectives using the voices of various characters around Offred is very convincing.
  * I do agree with other people mentioning how she does not discuss race – a society like this is bound to have something to say about this issue, and the lack of their perspective is unusual, slightly immersion-breaking but not fundamentally story-breaking.
