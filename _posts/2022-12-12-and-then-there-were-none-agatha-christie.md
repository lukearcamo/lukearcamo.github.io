★★★★☆ — Ten strangers, private island, ten impossible murders, ten possible suspects. Based on a nursury rhyme (renamed due to being *outdated* let's say), this is a classic Agatha Christie crime novel — the best-selling crime novel of all time. Proceed with caution as this genre is particularly vulnerable to spoilers.

## 1. Thoughts

* Genius, not in the typical grand or mind-bending way I am accustomed to, but the way Agatha Christie explains everything in the end makes it feel so simple, sensible and satisfying.
* I was expecting something unconventional, like maybe they all killed each other or there was an eleventh person, or perhaps even something supernatural though I would have been disappointed. But in the end it was simply one ordinary murderer.
* Most of the characters were well-developed. The fact that the reader could hear their thoughts and feelings and still be confused makes the crime even more impressive.
* Even the murderer's motives and thought processes were explained in the end, but no matter how self-righteously they justify themselves, personally I still think they are sick for enjoying every moment.
  * The fact that all ten of them committed crimes untouchable by law should prove that there is something wrong with the legal/judicial system. Instead of the murderer putting in effort in enacting justice themself, they should have put effort in changing the system, especially if, as in this case, they have power to do so. Not doing so implies acceptance of the status quo; imagine how many more untouchable criminals there are and will be in the world if the system is allowed to remain flawed.
  * Note that I don't claim to know how the system should be improved, I just think that maybe they should have tried to improve it first instead of committing ten murders.
* I would definitely like to read more Christie books in the future for their entertainment value
  * However, I think next time I should try to guess how things were done before reading the solution. Like a puzzle.
