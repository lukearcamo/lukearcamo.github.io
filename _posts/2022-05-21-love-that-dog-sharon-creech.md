## 1. Thoughts

* It's so cute omg
  * Me throughout: 🙂😂🥺🥹😭😥🥲😊
* Very short book, can finish it in under half an hour
  * It will make more sense if you read the referenced poems at the back of the book first.
* A children’s book that skillfully deals with difficult topics
* Realistic insight into the mind of a child – capacity for adult thinking, but it is the expression of it that is limited by language
* Gained a better understanding of poetry as so much more than just Dr. Seuss’s rhymes and Shakespeare’s complicated language
  * Unpopular opinion: I can appreciate the skill/beauty of Shakespeare, but I don’t enjoy reading him. I don’t like having to trace the etymology or cultural context for every word in a sentence, which ends up being a melodramatic way to express the “love” or “death” by naive characters who all die at the end due to an infuriating miscommunication. Perhaps this is just an unfortunate bias forged from how English class was taught in high school. anyways. im uncultured lol ik.
* Despite the *sad thing* that happens, the ending is super wholesome.
* The sequel, *Hate That Cat*, leans towards being more funny, but it's the same style and just as great!
  * To yall cat lovers, this doesn't actually hate on all cats, just one specific cat lol
