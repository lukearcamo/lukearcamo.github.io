Some (but not all) of the miscellaneous books read for high-school English classes, whose reviews are not long enough to warrant new posts. Note that the tags don't necessarily apply to all of them, dw im not calling Persepolis an American play lmao

<!--split-->

## Hedda Gabler by Henrik Ibsen
### September 2020 | ★★☆☆☆ <!-- omit from toc -->
* Enjoyed noticing the subtle body language and speech patterns revealing the complex web of interpersonal relationships.
* Did not always agree with Hedda's worldview, but that is precisely why I think she would be an interesting person to talk to.

## The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne
### October 2020 | ★★☆☆☆ <!-- omit from toc -->
* Prose was difficult to understand at times and probably increased the book's length threefold — somewhat understandable given novel writing was a relatively new medium.
* The ending's depiction of Hester and Pearl's quiet triumph over society was inspiring.

## Persepolis by Marjane Satrapi
### November 2020 | ★★★★☆ <!-- omit from toc -->
* Marjane's resilience is inspiring.
* Learned a lot about Iranian history, and its cultural differences with the West both before and after revolution.
* Her grandmother's message of "stay true to yourself" has stuck with me even today.
* *Edit November 11, 2022: Now that I'm reading The Handmaid's Tale, the intertextuality is strong with these two, and I appreciate both books even more.*

## The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald
### November 2021 | ★★★☆☆ <!-- omit from toc -->
* The ending had a poignant, wistful feeling — Mono no aware
* Underlying discussion of social class, a topic I never really knew or explored much of beforehand.
* Every character is complex, and so are the relationships between them.
* This upper class world was obviously not something I was familiar with, yet it was still interesting enough to allow me to become emotionally invested with the characters, the beautiful imagery, and the overall plot.

## Waiting for Godot by Samuel Beckett
### December 2021 | ★★★★☆ <!-- omit from toc -->
* Loved the minimalism.
* Many beautiful quotes and speeches.
* Did not feel boring or repetitive in any way. It felt like there were new things happening all the time, which can likely be attributed to the comedy and varied dialogue. Even though its comedy does not exactly match my tastes, I still admire it because I don't think the play would stand otherwise.
* Opened my eyes to the ideas of existentialism which helped me through a turbulent liminal period of my life.
