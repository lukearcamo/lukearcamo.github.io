‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ ‚Äî Lilith Iyapo wakes up in a pristine cell with vague memories of her husband and child dying in an car accident, and of war decimating the Earth. Eventually, she learns that what remained of humanity, including her was rescued by the Oankali, powerful, grotesque, and seemingly benevolent genetic engineers. But this favor comes at a cost. Should humanity die with integrity, having preserved its physical and cultural identity? Or should humans ensure the survival of their children in the new world, even if they become unrecognizable?

<!--split-->

## 1. Worldbuilding
* Truly alien atmosphere, combination of squicky and sterile. Even Earth felt alien.
* Lowkey horror ‚Äì Eldritch beings, fear of change/the unknown, body horror, Oankali talking like psychos. Butler mostly mutes this feeling by using a cold, dry, outsider, scientific tone.
* ‚ÄúTrade means change. Bodies change. Ways of living must change. Did you think your children would only look different?‚Äù
* The action parts of the story were quite thrilling. It isn‚Äôt like Le Guin‚Äôs chill storytelling, these parts were exciting.

### 1.1. Oankali culture

The Oankali have a very alien philosophy, unlike anything I have seen before.
* They are like Borg but utterly nonviolent.
* They consider cancer beautiful. Like‚Ä¶wtf and wow
* ‚ÄúNikanj, do you ever build machinery? Tamper with metal and plastic instead of living things?‚Äù
  * ‚ÄúWe do that when we have to. We‚Ä¶don‚Äôt like it. There‚Äôs no trade.‚Äù
* They are a post-scarcity society, yet they are not stagnant or decadent, because they still have a fundamental driving purpose: assimilation.
* Change is deeply ingrained to their culture. Every generation begets drastic changes, with only the organelles remaining constant. In essence, the Oankali are not the big creatures, they are the organelles.
  * I was suspicious of the fact that Jdahya was bipedal, with outer features matching the location of human organs. As discussed in previous reviews, I‚Äôm always looking for truly alien designs like the ocean of Solaris, not just slightly modified humans. So when I realized that anything that seems human about Oankali appearance or behaviour was probably adopted from humans, my mind was blown and I could excuse Butler‚Äôs design choices.
  * And especially after seeing the Akjai and knowing that they are only the great-grandparents of current constructs, it‚Äôs so hard to imagine how much more different they were before.
* They are morally grey
  * This can be likely attributed to their lack of understanding of human culture.
  * Nevertheless, their attitude towards their healing abilities is very pragmatic ‚Äì it is an act of kindness that is to be expected. Why should suffering continue? Humans are used to kindness having to be repaid, but to Oankali, healing is its own reward.
* They experience emotion, arguably more intensely and profoundly than humans, and they do express emotion. However they do so in a way that is often too subtle or hidden for us to detect. Thus, when it is noted, it is all the more impactful.
  * Side note: the Oankali would probably look so cool if visualized in a movie, the way their tentacles can knot up one moment, then ripple into a mirror smooth form in the next.
* Oankali culture is obsessed with the trinary, as opposed to Humans which prefer oneness or duality.

Things I love about the design of their culture:
* They are not a monolith unlike so many other aliens. They have:
  * Different clans e.g. Kaal, Lo
  * Divisions between Akjai (biological conservatives), Dinso (Earth settlers), and Toaht (gene traders but non-Earth settlers). They even have different biologies (remember Lilith‚Äôs accidental poisonous food waste)
  * Disagreements, misunderstandings, internal conflicts. e.g. Nikanj as a child was ignored, Akin was abandoned.
  * Generational differences, with Oankali vs construct misunderstandings (constructs advocate for humanity, experience/express emotions differently), like IRL boomers vs millennials/gen X.
* It isn‚Äôt just constructs adopting Oankali culture. The Oankali acquire human gestures as well ‚Äì the trade is not one-directional.
* The Oankali are not perfect or invulnerable. 
  * They make mistakes.
  * They have fears.
  * They misunderstand humans, mistreat them sometimes, they can be physically caught off guard, they can be bound to humans such that humans can hurt them back.
  * Their skills are subject to change and progress. Over the course of the story, the Oankali learned regeneration via cancer, Nikanj learned a new method for storing eggs/sperm for longer, and construct ooloi could shapeshift unlike old ooloi.

### 1.2. Human culture
* Their intolerance seemed extreme, but on second thought very realistic.
* In resister villages, even without the Oankali their society was pushed to such alien measures/situations. It is almost tragic and bleak. Despite the horrible things they do to each other, it‚Äôs not hard to sympathize with them like Akin.
  * ‚ÄúIf you were really busy, you didn‚Äôt have to think that maybe you were doing it all for nothing.‚Äù
  * Meanwhile people never grow old, can never have children, struggling to survive and living in fear while lying to themselves saying otherwise. Wasting away in spirit.

### 1.3. Conlang
* Oral Oankali has a unique phonology, and it doesn‚Äôt do anything quirky with the orthography. Though used only in naming, I would love to see it expanded upon.
* Interestingly, they can speak via other media as well ‚Äì chemical signals, scents, nerve stimulation. The ships can speak with radio signals. The Akjai are deaf but can speak with touch and bioluminescence.

### 1.4. Technology
* Biological radio communication?!
* Nuclear fission within a living organism?!
* Ooloi can perceive subatomic particles?!
* oh yeah and the genetic engineering is cool i guess /s

## 2. Writing Style

### 2.1. Format, Medium, Structure
* Standard trilogy, standard novels
* Multisperspective ‚Äì a Human female, the first construct male, and the first construct ooloi. Nice.
* I like how she capitalizes Human, to make it the proper name of a group of people parallel to ‚ÄúOankali‚Äù.
* The scale of the worldbuilding, with a story that spans three books, reminds me of the grandiosity  of *Dune*.

### 2.2. Imagery, Description, Poetry
* Excellent approximations of experiences that a human could never have, like the psychedelic imagery of Harlan Ellison and Robert Silverberg.
* In writing, I learned that it‚Äôs ok to repeat information from previous books. Assume the reader is new to your worldbuilding.
* When suspending the reader‚Äôs disbelief, I learned that it is better to aim for a feeling of awe than suspicion.

## 3. Plot
* The first book, Dawn, actually resembles a post-apocalyptic YA novel since it is more drama/relationships focused. Yet it does not solely consist of those elements: it deals with philosophical, sociological, and scientific themes.
* When Jo√£o left, that ambivalent emotion is exactly what I crave in stories about human relationships ‚Äì neither strictly positive or negative, but rather an emotion that is hard to find in real life.

## 4. Characters, Dialogue

### 4.1. Lilith

Lilith is a rational leader, the perfect choice to be a bridge between two cultures.
  * She is willing to learn
  * The least problematic/violent people were the curious ones, like Lilith, Tino, Gabe and Tate, people who sought more information before taking action.
  * She is willing to hear all perspectives.
  * Whenever she converses with individuals or performs a speech to a group, people listen to her wisdom.
  * She is very perceptive about people's personalities and relationships.
  * She has a survivor mentality.
  * But she isn‚Äôt perfectly brainwashed by the Oankali ‚Äì she has moments of bitterness and resentment. She is a less shallow character as a result.

### 4.2. Akin
  * He reminds me of Paul from *Dune*, with the messianic themes surrounding him.
  * He reminds me of Alia from *Dune*, the way he matures intellectually so quickly, and the colorful sensory descriptions reminiscent of prescience from spice.
    * Finally a kid in a story who is a smart team member instead of a liability LOL
    * I like how, similar to the Oankali, he has superpowers but he isn‚Äôt overpowered ‚Äì he is balanced, he is still vulnerable
  * The way I imagine him, he's so cute and innocent but the way his kidnappers treat him üò≠ like I pity him so much ü•∫
    * When he felt lonely, when they held him so precariously, suffering in silence, no complaining, even trying his best to help them, I just wanted to hug him so bad üò≠üò≠üò≠
  * When Akin shared his traumatic experiences with Dehkiaht and Tiikichahk, and the other Oankali, it felt empowering, like for once a Human perspective could persuade an Oankali to change. I sensed the start of a sort of revolution.
    * This second book, and the creation of a Mars colony, provides a sense of vindication for the Oankali. They may have been morally wrong previously, but at least they are taking steps to remedy that. Reconciliation.
  * When Gabe saw him again, I loved how Butler subverted the tongue‚Äôs symbolism and made it a trustworthy/comforting sight for once.
  * Akin was the first (half-)Oankali to successfully challenge the Oankali idea of biological determinism. Instead of listening to his destiny as a solitary male, he chose a different path with the Mars colony.
  * Akin being a leader (hierarchy) and seeking allies (factionalism, individualism) are all qualities of his Human side. This revolution could have never happened by an Oankali.

### Others
* Diverse representation not for its own sake, or any sake in fact ‚Äì not under a spotlight, not for any plot value. It is accepted and normalized.
  * There was even someone from Manila, which I didn‚Äôt expect. This doesn‚Äôt happen often in famous works, so I was pleasantly surprised.
* I love how Nikanj has a multidimensional character and is not just ostensibly cold like Kahguyaht. It expresses emotion and acquired human behaviour. For example, it demonstrates individualism by choosing to shield Jodahs and Aaor despite going against all the other Oankali. It‚Äôs a more likeable character as a result.
  * That‚Äôs a good way to write characters actually. You can control whether they are likeable or not by how nuanced/detailed you make them.
* In many ways, these three books are like coming-of-age stories ‚Äì Lilith, Akin, and Jodahs searching for their identity in a confusing world.
  * Nikanj quote to Jodahs: ‚ÄúGive yourself time. You‚Äôre a new kind of being. There‚Äôs never been anyone like you before. but there‚Äôs no flaw in you. You just need time to find out more about yourself.‚Äù
    * Words to live by frfr
* Constructs also provide an opportunity to explore the challenges of belonging to two cultures. Akin, not having body tentacles, or a paired sibling, cannot connect with others as well as the other children. Jodahs and Aaor are seen as something new and therefore dangerous.
* Butler breaks convention, at least for scifi in the 20th century, by portraying most men as hypermasculine, lascivous, largely one-dimensional characters, the way women were typically portrayed shallow and negatively in old sci-fi stories. Personally, I still think it isn‚Äôt good to have shallow characters, but who is to say that, perhaps in such an extreme, alien situation people wouldn‚Äôt regress like this? Additionally, it is an interesting feature that serves to highlight existing biases. Of course having the majority of men like this is unrealistic, but this behaviour is very much real, and it‚Äôs important to acknowledge it. Sci-fi comments on social issues like this by pushing them to the logical extreme.
  * I saw [a review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/341081223) criticizing Butler for her portrayal of these social issues, but I think their disappointment can be attributed to an inability to separate the author from the story. They were attracted to Dawn by the claim that Butler was a prominent feminist writer, expecting an idealistic world for women, then disliked it for exposing and magnifying real issues against women or about gender.
    * Firstly, these people were from the 80s. Not only was Butler/the book from the 80s, the point of divergence in this alternative history was also the 80s, as the Cold War escalated into nuclear war.
    * Secondly, Butler did not advocate for these ideas, the same way Atwood does not advocate for Gilead in *The Handmaid's Tale*. They promote feminist values by showcasing the ridiculousness of the contrary. This is a speculative, post-apocalyptic *dystopia*; the reader is meant to be disgusted and cautioned.
    * ‚ÄúProcreation is at the forefront of all their relationships.‚Äù ‚Äì Yes this may be bad for us IRL, but just ask, What if?
    * Thirdly, being intolerant of a book because it contradicts your ideology, instead of using it as a dialectic tool to better understand other perspectives is...let‚Äôs do better please
    * Fourthly, this review is also incomplete, because Butler subverts many of these bad ideas as well.
      * She makes Oankali make certain relationship decisions based on emotion over biology.
      * Humans still have a chance to fight this destiny in the subsequent books.
      * See Biological Determinism below
    * ‚ÄúBiology is destiny for Butler.‚Äù ‚Äì **Wrong**, biology is destiny *for the Oankali*.

## 5. Themes

### 5.1. Humanity‚Äôs hierarchical behaviour plus intelligence as inevitably destructive

My interpretation:
* Hierarchical behaviour alone, without intelligence, works effectively ‚Äì bees, ants, colonial insects.
* Intelligence promotes independence which threatens the hierarchy.
* On the other hand, hierarchy can override intelligence and promote irrational decision making.
* I don‚Äôt think there is any real-world example of intelligence without hierarchy. As mentioned in the book, intelligence has been in the service of social structures since early in our planet‚Äôs evolutionary history.

### 5.2. Morality
* See discussion of morality under Oankali culture above
* Butler also takes human actions and demonstrates how problematic they are by simply putting them into an alien culture. All it takes is a reframing of the problem in order to overcome our biases or highlight them.
  * ‚ÄúHumans had done these things to captive breeders‚Äìall for a higher good, of course.‚Äù

### 5.3. Nature vs. Nurture, Biological Determinism
* Lilith regarding Paul Titus: ‚ÄúHe did what you and his so-called family set him up to do!‚Äù
* Consent, Free Will
  * How much of our behaviour and decision-making is governed by our surroundings, by the butterfly effect of a single chemical?
  * What is love?
    * What is ‚Äúreal‚Äù if everything we perceive can be governed by chemical signals?
    * What is a more valid way of conveying information, the things we say or what our body says?
      * If the latter, are we at a disadvantage since the Oankali can control their own and perceive others‚Äô body language in more detail?
    * The feeling of strongly loving and strongly hating the same person is an interesting conflict, something that doesn‚Äôt happen often with humans IRL.
* However, I also like how Butler doesn't merely advocate for biological determinism. She poses the idea and challenges it. She poses questions and provides multiple answers. This is ideally how sci-fi authors should write about an idea.
  * The fact that the Mars colony exists shows that even some Oankali, like Akin‚Äôs Akjai teacher, are willing to go against their philosophy, having faith in a second chance for humanity.
  * Another way Butler challenges this idea is with Akin during metamorphosis talking to Yori about humans overcoming their fate via chance, random mutations, and Oankali mistakes.

### 5.4. Discrimination
Racism, misogyny, homophobia, miscegenation, and neurodivergence is viewed from an external lens as the Oankali struggle to understand these dimensions of human division.
* Human-Oankali discrimination
  * The most obvious is that Humans are xenophobic of the Oankali
    * And this is complicated by love/attraction ‚Äì cognitive dissonance
  * Oankali/constructs think differently than humans, and therefore face the challenge of acquiring neurotypical behaviour, for example looking at people when talking.
* Human-Human discrimination
  * Nikanj correctly paired Joseph and Lilith due to similar ways of thinking, whereas other Oankali made incorrect predictions by only considering skin color.
  * Lilith had to explain to Nikanj why some hostile humans disliked her and Joseph for their relationship, appearance, and capabilities. Nikanj and the Oankali couldn‚Äôt understand how elevating Lilith makes her more of a target.
  * During his wanderings, Akin encountered a white-supremacist village and was mildly confused why they hated him.
  * Parallels with The Handmaid‚Äôs Tale ‚Äì the scarcity of reproduction led to the limitation of women‚Äôs rights.

### 5.5. Miscellaneous
* Colonialism ‚Äì As Butler mentioned during an interview, the Oankali-Human relationship parallels our own history of colonialism, particularly the slave trade. On the other hand, many of the things the Oankali do are definitely more benevolent than what humans have done.
* Betrayal ‚Äì A common theme within Dawn, beautifully emphasized in the final scene, is the ideological conflict of whether Lilith is a Judas goat or the leader/saviour of humanity.
* ‚ÄúI always heard you could tell by the hands‚Äìthat the‚Ä¶others would have too many fingers or fingers that bend in un-Human ways.‚Äù ‚Äì reminds me of AI today lol
* Destruction of pre-war infrastructure as a form of censorship
* Gun control ‚Äì Both Oankali and some people dislike guns because:
  * It is the only effective weapon against Oankali. It‚Äôs interesting how the largest threats to Oankali are physical things like rapid projectiles or heights/falling, as opposed to biological threats like viruses or disease.
  * It encourages violence towards other Humans even though Humans are already scarce.
