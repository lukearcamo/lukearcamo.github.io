‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ ‚Äî Centuries in the future, a New York detective partners with a robot to solve the murder of a prominent Spacer, an inhabitant of the Outer Worlds. As he confronts his own prejudices against Spacers and robots, he begins to see injustice within his own Earth cities.<br><br> Asimov was a biochemist and leading author in scifi. He wanted to demonstrate the versatility of sci-fi by combining it with another genre: detective stories. He also pioneered social science fiction and the Three Laws of Robotics. His work continues to have an impact today.

## 1. Plot and Worldbuilding
* Plot ‚Äî Very engaging, twists do not feel forced
* The "reverse" colonization is an interesting twist on our own history, how the colonies are in less poverty than their place of origin
* This flavour of retrofuturism is not my type. I there are other forms of retrofuturism I like such as [Dynamo Dream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGZ_2RuJ2A&pp=ygUMZHluYW1vIGRyZWFt) (seriously, do yourself a favor and watch this short film) but some of the technology is unrealistic and poor engineering design.
  * Almost like a fever dream or a child's imagination. There's nothing inherently bad with this, I just can't really take it seriously.
  * The moving walkways feel so precarious, though I guess the same could be said about our present-day streets of fast-moving blocks of metal.
* Overall, I think the worldbuilding reason is the only reason why this is not 5 stars. It lies on the blurred border between Golden Age sci-fi and New Wave sci-fi. It has elements of hard and soft sci-fi. Nevertheless, I understand it its a product of its time, and it wouldn't stand any other way. Too much soft sci-fi and it would be dense with philosophy like Borges, too hard and it would be too creatively restrained to explore a wild and entertaining future.

## 2. Themes
* I like the exploration of philosophical themes ‚Äî the social impact of robots/AI, discrimination, dystopias, socialism, the survival of humanity, etc.
* The juxtaposition of biblical themes in a scifi story is rare yet integrated quite skillfully. Imagine my surprise when I found out Asimov himself was an atheist.

## 3. Writing Style
* The writing is fine (neither too pretentious nor too vernacular), but the speech/dialogue occasionally feels outdated and cringe.
  * The way Lije swears is so...unique üò∂
    * No cuz wtf is THAT eleven-letter thing
    * Like I get how an f-bomb or sh** would not get past the censors back in the day but still, just say shoot, or dammit, or even avoid swearing whenever possible.
  * The kid reminds me of those ‚Äúdrake the type of guy‚Äù memes lol
  * The names/slang especially feel Western (see On Worldbuilding Alienness below).
    * The most exotic name you could come up with is "Daneel Olivaw"? "Daniel" + "Oliver" with an accent/lisp?
    * This is also an issue I (and conlanger David J. Peterson) have with Dune: Would ‚ÄúPaul‚Äù and ‚ÄúJessica‚Äù really exist ten millenia from now, along with a minimally-evolved Arabic language? But I digress.

## 4. On Worldbuilding Alienness
* I think this story's retrofuturism is too Western-centric.
* Sci-fi can be so much more alien than the people of the 1950s could imagine. I understand that this is easy to say from my modern perspective‚Äîperhaps that is how future people will see our current imagination‚Äîbut on a scale of alienness ours is palpably higher than theirs.
* For example, the story considers 8 billion as overpopulated thousands of years into the future. The world population in the 1950s was 2.5 billion. Today we have 8 billion and don't need to ration yeast or live in urban communes. At least not everyone does yet, and certainly not most people in the Eastern US, which the story is set in. Of course 8 billion in America would be a lot, but think of how much open space there is around the world: the Sahara, the oceans, the Amazon, etc. It would be a shame to have to pave these, but if we truly were desperate we'd have plenty of opportunities. Furthermore, most of our exponential population growth happened in places like India and China, not in a place like New York.
* Nevertheless, I can understand how worldbuilding can be limited by the author's time period. And after reading the ending I can begin to appreciate it more, because now I can see how much effort was put into orchestrating such a detailed and interconnected plot/murder. Even the political situation of the Outer Worlds had an impact on the murder.

## 5. Ending
* The ending was great. Honestly I found it equally, if not more, surprising, creative, and genius than And Then There Were None.
  * The ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù was pleasantly shocking like all of the previous twists.
  * Reading the beginning, I hoped that Lije would have character development, and my wish was certainly granted.
  * I like how every party reached a compromise in the end, and even the murderer felt remorseful. Clich√© perhaps, but there is a certain lightheartedness in this story that is not present in other dystopian stories like The Handmaid's Tale, and this allows a more balanced exploration of philosophical ideas.
