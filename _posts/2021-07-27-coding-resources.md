Here is a list of various online resources about computer graphics and web development, or coding in general. These are very useful for me, so I thought I'd share them. They are ordererd from beginner-friendly to more advanced.

* I first learned about 3d graphics from WebGL Fundamentals — [https://webglfundamentals.org/](https://webglfundamentals.org/)
* Similarly, I first learned about Three.js from Three.js Fundamentals — [https://threejsfundamentals.org/](https://threejsfundamentals.org/)
* This tutorial article provides a very simple introduction to shaders using Shadertoy — [https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/a-beginners-guide-to-coding-graphics-shaders--cms-23313](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/a-beginners-guide-to-coding-graphics-shaders--cms-23313)
* W3Schools is an excellent website containing tutorials and documentation for multiple languages, and it even has an online code tester — [https://www.w3schools.com/](https://www.w3schools.com/)
* MDN Web Docs, like W3Schools, contains both tutorials and documentation, but it's specifically for web development and it's less beginner friendly than W3Schools (in my opinion) — [https://developer.mozilla.org/](https://developer.mozilla.org/)
* Can I Use is a tool for checking whether certain browsers support various HTML, CSS, and JS features — [https://caniuse.com/](https://caniuse.com/)
* Three.js code and documentation, sometimes even includes links to other resources — [https://threejs.org/docs/](https://threejs.org/docs/)
* Despite its name, Learn OpenGL not only teaches OpenGL, but it also explains many 3D graphics concepts which can be used outside of OpenGL — [https://learnopengl.com/](https://learnopengl.com/)
* Wikipedia and Wikibooks are excellent for exploring a specific topic in great detail — (https://www.wikipedia.org/)[https://www.wikipedia.org/], (https://www.wikibooks.org/)[https://www.wikibooks.org/]
* Stack Overflow and Reddit are forums with many categories to explore. There, you can participate in discussions and ask your own questions — [https://stackoverflow.com/](https://stackoverflow.com/), [https://www.reddit.com/](https://www.reddit.com/)
* CSS-Tricks contains very useful tips for web development — [https://www.w3schools.com/](https://www.w3schools.com/)
* The official OpenGL wiki is very helpful, providing both documentation and tips & tricks — [https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Main_Page](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Main_Page)
* Inigo Quilez's articles are filled with interesting math and shader tips. Every post is a banger im literally his #1 stan — [https://www.iquilezles.org/www/index.htm](https://www.iquilezles.org/www/index.htm)
* Exploring Shadertoy can provide artistic inspiration and insight into new concepts and technique. WARNING: You will need a good computer to run their shaders, which tend to autoplay! — [https://www.shadertoy.com/](https://www.shadertoy.com/)
