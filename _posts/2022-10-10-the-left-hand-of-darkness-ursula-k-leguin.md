★★★★★ — Genly Ai is an envoy of an interplanetary consortium sent to invite the planet Winter. Though its inhabitants are human like the other planets, they have one fundamental difference: ambisexuality. Each month, they enter *kemmer* briefly as male or female, only to return to their default androgynous form. In spite of this having such profound cultural implications, Ai grows to find himself as similar to them as he is different.<br><br>But this doesn't make his job any easier. He is a distrusted outsider in a harsh icy world rife with political division. Only one other person sees the consortium as a way out of their age-old feud — someone who believes in the dream enough to abandon it.

* Favourite book next to Dune; slightly less overtly grandiose, but the worldbuilding feels cosmic in scale nonetheless.
* I did not expect this book to be so highly emotional. The magnitude of Estraven's sacrifice is astonishing.
* Even though this is soft sci-fi, Le Guin still pays attention to the science — relativity, climate, even Hubble's constant. That footnote was particularly fascinating even though it was irrelevant to the story.

## 1. Writing Style
* Vivid poetic imagery, so much slice of life, small sensory details; as the afterword says, it adds a touch of optimism amid such bleak conditions
* Epistolary format adds to the realism
* I love nonlinear storytelling — the myths interspersed between current events also adds to the realism

## 2. Constructed Language
* Used in the names of people, places and other ideas
* Conlang feels realistic. No stereotypical alien x's and apostrophes.
* Unique phonotactics — I would describe it as a mixture of German, Arabic, English
* There are even differences between Orgota and Karhidish — another point for the non-monolithic culture mentioned below.
* Linguistic relativity — Descriptive words for snow/cold, immersive expressions like *nusuth* and *gichy-michy* tied to the culture
* If this gets a movie adaptation (the dream, and I hope Villeneuve directs it like he did with Dune), I would love [David J. Peterson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_J._Peterson) to expand the conlang like he did for Game of Thrones and the Dune movie's Chakobsa.

## 3. Characters
* Every character is so complex. Even the main characters both have imperfections, and no character is clearly evil or antagonistic. Conflict stems from human mistakes, naivety.

## 4. Themes
* Motifs like duality, *nusuth*, and darkness

### 4.1. Politics, Corruption, Violence, Power
* The fact that these are still present in Gethenian society speaks volumes about conflict and the thirst for power being inherent to human nature. Like Dune, they add complexity to the story, but stay away from being the central focus. Instead, there is more focus on lower-level human relationships instead.

### 4.2. Culture
There are two main influencing factors that make it differ from our culture: Winter and Gender. Other than those, everything is strikingly similar to our culture — they have conflict, love, loyalty, betrayal, politics, survival, refugees, hospitality, honor, death. Nevertheless, there are minor differences that add to the richness of the culture.
* I love how the planet is not a homogeneous monolith. The climate and geography vary throughout: volcanoes, islands, different kinds of winter from the thore forests to the gobrin sheet. It is also politically varied: two main nationstates with contrasting cultures.
* Le Guin subverts our own world's history/culture
  * e.g She put the Taoist religion in the feudalistic medieval nation, while the monotheistic religion in the Soviet-like state
  * e.g. lack of war, only small-scale raids
  * e.g. Technology is electric and slow-paced, communication centered on radio due to cultural preference (from oral storytelling) for audio rather than writing

### 4.3. Gender
One of the central questions Le Guin wanted to explore was essentially “when you strip away gender from identity, at its core is there something fundamentally human that we all share?” And the beauty of this story is that she does not answer this definitively. There are times when she seems to say yes (the culture being similar to ours). There are times when she says no (lack of war, hospitality, leniency of guards at Pulefen, Estraven's capacity for sacrifice, etc.)

This was a keystone work in both the feminist and gay rights movements. However, (some)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Left_Hand_of_Darkness#Reception] people did not like the book because it uses he/him pronouns. Ok but consider the following reasons/alternatives:
  * Neopronouns were not popular during the 60s. Consider the context in which the book was written, and forgive it.
  * Le Guin could've used they/them but this was also not popular in the 60s. Also, in a story where one of the central conflicts is the individual vs society, distinguishing between single people and groups seems important.
  * For Ai's accounts, perhaps this is could be interpreted a in-universe reflection of his misogyny manifesting in his writing.
  * For Estraven's accounts and the myths, this could also be interpreted as a misogynistic bias from the translators manifesting in the translation.
  * Like this is a valid criticism (as a linguistics enthusiast I also dislike the English pronoun system compared to other languages), but it is really frustrating to see people not liking the book as a whole just for a pronoun, which is such a minor detail in comparison to the overlooked *leaps* this work has made in their favour.

Additionally,

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Left_Hand_of_Darkness#Reception">Some</a> people saw Estraven's death as homophobic. Well here's some propositional logic: Gay people are human too. All humans die. ∴ Estraven can die.<br>
        Be honest, if Le Guin truly was homophobic, she couldn't have even *approached* anything like this story. She simply didn't feel like all stories need a "they lived happily ever after," and I respect that. There are plenty of other fairy tales to get intoxicated to instead.
