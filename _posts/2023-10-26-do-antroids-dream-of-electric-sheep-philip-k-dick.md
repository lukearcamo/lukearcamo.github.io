‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ ‚Äî If it looks like a human, and behaves like a human, is it human? This is one of the many difficult questions Rick Deckard asks himself as he is tasked with "retiring" rogue androids in a polluted, irradiated Earth populated by a society devoid of any hope and barely holding on to the basic concept of empathy.

<!--split-->

## 1. Worldbuilding
* Atmosphere
  * Dusty, bleak, hopeless, gloomy, grey, dead, but with a faint failed facade of liveliness
* Culture
  * Brief mention of larger events, like the war and the diaspora, create the feeling of a larger history beyond the story. This is a hallmark of good worldbuilding.
  * Despite being created in the 1960s, the lack of focus on hard technology and more focus on sociology means that the worldbuilding and message are still, if not more, applicable today.
  * It‚Äôs interesting to see how people of the past thought the 2020s would look like
    * Soviet Russia still existing üíÄ
* Technology
  * No details on how things work, only that they do and what effects they have on the people around them. For this reason, I would classify this as soft sci-fi, despite the realism of the technology.

## 2. Writing style
* Format, Medium, Structure
  * Not too long, not too short
  * Standard story arc shape
* Imagery, Description, Word Choice
  * Several moments of rich intricate imagery e.g. the silence with Isidore near the beginning
  * Imagery does not fill the book; lots of dialogue and inner thoughts too to keep the reader engaged with the drama
  * For such a bleak world, the author uses a lot of comedy and wordplay. It does well to lighten the mood. It is not afraid to be taken unseriously.

## 3. Plot
* Standard arc, nothing shocking. In fact, it‚Äôs vaguely like the hero‚Äôs journey?

## 4. Characters, Dialogue
* This diversity creates a complex class system involving offworld humans, Earth humans, androids, infertile humans, and ‚Äúchickenheads.‚Äù They interact with each other in interesting ways, forming a network of community and discrimination.
* Nevertheless, I wish I got to see other perspectives e.g. women seemed to have a marginal role in the story, 

## 5. Motifs, Symbols, Themes
* Each aspect of technology or worldbuilding (androids, the electric animals, the empathy box, the mood organ, infertility, dust) seem unrelated on the surface level, but they all relate to each other in their effects and in the thoughts of the characters. Well-crafted and well-integrated.

## 7. Themes
* What defines humanity from something natural or artificial?
  * This is especially relevant today with AI.
  * The edition I read had an essay at the end of the book discussing this, ‚ÄúThe Dangers of Individualism and the Human Relationship to Technology in Philip K. Dick‚Äôs Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?‚Äù by Chris Sims, written in 2009. It has many ideas I agree with, for example, that technology is at the behest of culture and humanity, not isolated from it as though it were some unnatural phenomenon. However, I think it fails to capture what is truly at stake in our contemporary situation. The issue is not that AI can do things humans can, it‚Äôs that it can do it better and faster (üéµstronger‚Ä¶üéµ sorry). For example, art can now be made with reduced time and effort, just by typing a prompt. There‚Äôs a fear of obsolescence. The androids in this story are different from ours because they don‚Äôt make humans obsolete. They don‚Äôt flood Earth, they trickle. They don‚Äôt have superpowers, they are soft and biological. There is a constant force, either their short lifespan or bounty hunters, that ensures they don‚Äôt last long. Nevertheless, for a story written in 1968, it still makes a valuable contribution to our current dialogue regarding AI. The book serves as a window into what our world could become, and, like the androids, pressures us to re-evaluate what it means to be human.

## 8. Overall
Prescient. Funny and depressing all-in-one.
