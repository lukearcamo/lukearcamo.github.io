## 1. Thoughts

* I was introduced to this author from [*Love That Dog*]({% post_url 2022-05-21-love-that-dog-sharon-creech %}). Quite the stark difference lol
* First experience reading a war novel — very different to the big-picture way war is depicted in history class, which is what I was used to.
* Visceral imagery — The reader can feel the characters' physical pain and relief.
* The author has a broad dynamic range of language styles, from vernacular slang to poetic imagery — a telltale sign of an author's writing skill.
* Did not just recount physical experiences. Philosophical questions were asked as well: sympathy and understanding of similarities towards enemies, psychological effects of war, truth and propaganda, corruption in bureaucracy, racism, fear, masculinity.
* This is apparently a frequently censored or challenged book. Although there is offensive or "outdated" terminology, violence, racism, drugs, etc., this is not a valid reason to censor or cancel any book. It is the reader's responsibility to view any idea through the lense of its historical context. It is not the author's responsibility to cater to a reader's individual subjective feelings, but to merely present the truth as accurately and objectively as possible; it definitely isn't as if Myers was endorsing these things in any way. The reader has the freedom to put their book down, but not to put everyone else's book down.
* Would read the author's other works in the future
