<!--split-->

## 1. Worldbuilding
* Atmosphere
  * Even the description of mundane life felt magical as someone who is unfamiliar with 19th-century England.
  * Though this is somewhat an alternate history with fictional characters, a lot of the places and events even line up to our own history. Clarke really did her research.
* Culture
  * The author clearly did detailed research on English history
  * The larger patterns of human behaviour, public sentiment felt simplistic, almost predictable, but too accurate and indisputable. In the end, the directness of the people’s thinking and behaviour felt realistic.
* Technology (or in this case, magic)
  * I sensed that there are rules, limits to the power of magic, but it was never explicitly described. It was a soft magic system. This allowed for more of the focus to be on the social impacts of magic, rather than the inner workings of the magic itself.

## 2. Writing style
* Format, Medium, Structure
  * Very long book, almost tedious to get through, but once I realized that this wasn’t a conventional saga of a hero’s journey with a clear direction and ending, and more of a recollection of miscellaneous events and perspectives merely tied to the same place/time period, the length became bearable and I was entertained by the drama.
  * The footnotes were an interesting choice. I haven’t really seen this before in a novel, but I greatly appreciated how it allowed me to delve deep into the worldbuilding rabbit holes.
* Imagery, Description, Poetry
  * Not as psychedelic or awe-inspiring like some of the authors I’ve read, but that’s perfectly fine. It works so well in this context.
  * Clarke even managed to capture the old manner of language from this time period.
  * Pathetic fallacy – The way the setting was described, often grey and labyrinthine, had a purpose. In fact, it could be argued that this was not a fallacy at all since the surrounding objects were not inanimate…
  * The fairy language was described beautifully – idk how it could even be adapted well to a more visual medium

## 3. Plot
* See Format, Medium, Structure above
* Despite the majority seeming to lack direction, the way all perspectives tied together in the end was satisfying.
* The way the prophecy came true in the end was creative.

## 4. Characters, Dialogue
* I love how marginalized (e.g. women, Black) perspectives are given their own spotlight in the story. In this way, Clarke merges the old tradition of literature with modern sentiments.
* Clarke’s main inspirations were 19th century authors like Charles Dickens and Jane Austen, and this is clearly seen in the dialogue and characters’ thought processes. There is a certain sense of childlike curiosity or straightforward reasoning? Idk how else to describe it, it makes the characters endearing and sympathetic, there is no definite antagonist or protagonist. Even for the fairy, though he is dangerous and warrants separation from society, I can’t help but think that his ignorance is part of his nature.
* Each character has their own quirks and flaws that makes them all extremely memorable.
* Because the setting is in 19th century England, any character flaws that do manifest are easy to deem a product of this time. Clarke provides a window into this world, but leaves interpretation or commentary largely to the reader.
* Lots of great humour, something missing from a lot of the other books I’ve read – delivered in the typical dry, deadpan British way

## 5. Motifs, Symbols, Themes
* Like in her other novel Piranesi, liminal spaces are featured once again. Clarke’s portrayal of them perfectly capture the emotions associated with them. I wish liminal spaces were more prominent in literature, these are some of the only (and therefore best) portrayals I’ve seen so far.
* Intersectionality – as mentioned, the story frequently switches around between diverse perspectives. This is also another one of the reasons why the long story never gets tiring.

## 6. Overall
For a debut novel this is ridiculously good.
