★★★★★ — Spice is a rare nootropic drug only found on the desert planet Arrakis, territory of giant sandworms and the native Fremen. Yet its promises of health, longevity, prescience, interstellar navigation, and death upon withdrawal make it the most economically valuable commodity in the Imperium.<br><br>When Arrakis is given to House Atreides by the Emperor, its former owners the Harkonnens will stop at nothing to win it back. Caught in the center of imperial politics, Fremen culture, and a millenia-old shadow government, heir Paul Atreides discovers that the fate of humanity rests in his hands, and in the mysterious Golden Path he must maneuver it into.

*Note May 25, 2023: I plan to write a longer and more detailed article in the future, in line with my more recent reviews. I also want to write a review of Dune Messiah, and I have yet to read the later books in the series. I especially want to discuss the moral ambiguity, messianic themes, ethical dilemmas, literal prediction of the social impact of AI, and so many more complex ideas I glossed over here.*

## 1. Thoughts

* One of my all-time favourite books.
* Detailed fascinating culture, both the Fremen and the Imperium
* Complex politics was engaging
* Did not spoon feed information. This was sometimes confusing regarding the meaning of made-up words. Nevertheless it added to the immersion, because it felt like learning a language — you learn the meaning as you go along. Words that are mentioned once with no explanation can simply be understood with context, yet add so much depth, as if the universe is grander than what is shown on the pages.
* The subversion of heroic themes, more evident in Dune Messiah, was creative.
* Loved the ecological themes — relatively unique among sci-fi, and doesn't seem like it would fit in with this story but it does.
* The Baron feels comically evil and heavy-handed. He is politically and socially competent, but it felt like he was no match for Paul. Piter De Vries would have made a more devious and dangerous villain — like Paul, he was also on spice.
