★★★★☆ — The sequel to *The Handmaid's Tale*, this book alternates between three womens' perspectives: Aunt Lydia, a divorced judge coerced into the politics of Gilead; Agnes Jemima, a girl seeking the truth about her family while trying to avoid an arranged marriage, and Daisy, a rebellious Canadian teen who becomes involved in a smuggling operation after her adoptive parents die in a bomb. As their paths intertwine, cracks form in the foundation of lies upon which Gilead rests.

## 1. Worldbuilding
* I always wondered how the Aunts came to be, and this book provided a believable backstory — how often in history those in power make people turn against their own kind in order to survive.
* The cultural contact between the Gilead-trained girls and a foreigner was not just sometimes funny, but it revealed more about their characters.
* Whereas one of the main aims of *The Handmaid's Tale* is to introduce Gilead and the base worldbuilding (which was interesting), this book aims to expand on other facets, assuming the reader already has background knowledge. Like in other works, I enjoy this feature because it makes me feel part of the world, as though I have inside knowledge, allowing for more opportunities to use this knowledge in unusual ways to build/subvert the plot, evoke emotions, etc.
* Cultural contact is one of my favorite tropes because it reveals more about the characters/culture in how they react in the face of something unusual, and often leads to conflict.
  * Worldbuilding alone is an anthropological textbook. Without an unusual event as a reference point for a beginning, middle, and end, there is no story.
* As Atwood mentions, the axiom of Gilead was that everything about it is derivative. Hence, the politics, both internal (purges/factionalism, corruption, censorship) and external (international indifference, Mayday's operations, etc.), were strikingly realistic and ingenious.
* I was surprised to see that the majority of fans of the first book dislike this book so much. In hindsight, I do agree with their points that there was less political commentary and less ambiguity left to the imagination. In the end, this book is simply meant to be in a more thrilling/entertainment style than the first one. I personally did not mind; I see merits to both.

## 2. Writing Style

### 2.1. Format, Medium, Structure
* I love epistolary stories!
* Sometimes it was a bit hard to differentiate between the two of the girls' testimonies until a few sentences in where their personalities are shown more.
  * I think this says something about their character design...
  * This issue was also exacerbated by the unimaginative chapter titles.

### 2.2. Imagery, Description, Poetry
* Personally, I feel this aspect was improved from the first book, perhaps attributed to her growth as a writer (*The Handmaid's Tale* was published in 1985, *The Testaments* was published in 2019).
* As usual, Atwood uses colourful imagery and abundant metaphors. However, now they are less bizarre/random and more relatable than in the first book (fr tho like remember the ~~worms~~ "lips" on the ground like wtf)
* Loved the occasional added comedy compared to the first book, not just from the cultural contact situations, but also the disparity between Aunt Lydia's outward image and Jade's bluntness. It helps balance the bleak dystopian tone.
* So many based and big-brain quotes, truths that are written in clever ways

### 2.3. Word choice
* The sterile biblical language of Gilead pervaded the first book and this one. But in addition, seeing phrases such as "Give 'em hell!" in this book were a breath of fresh air. It's strange how we take such phrases for granted, but within the context of Gilead they become so much more meaningful, more elevated.
* As mentioned in my previous book reviews, I believe that the dynamic range of the author's voice is indicative of their skill with language. In this case, Atwood ranges from pious prayers to comedic/blunt comments. Such diversity of tone keeps the story feeling fresh and honest, as though it were representative of the entire human experience.

## 3. Plot
* Less political commentary, more political intrigue. There was so much tea at Ardua Hall, between the girls at school, among the Marthas, Paula, etc.
* <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>
    <p>Echoing the historical notes concluding the first book and hinting at Offred's successful escape, the fact that we are reading Aunt Lydia's account means she made the right choice when she was “poised on the razor's edge.” It's like a clickbait thumbnail which openly reveals the answer to a video title; the alluring part is knowing how they got to that answer.</p>

## 4. Characters
* Amidst the stifling air of the regime, the various characters' growing doubts and small rebellions felt like displays of power that were minor yet oddly exhilarating. Agnes' coming of age exemplifies this.
* Aunt Lydia
  * Loved her redemption arc since the first book
  * Big brain politics
    * Several times in which she was able to kill two birds with one stone
    * Slippery words, pretending to conspire with others when in reality playing her own game
    * Needling others using religious doctrine, questioning their commitment to the dogma and pretending to be more pious than them
      * This irony adds to the aforementioned comedy.
    * After Gilead's tumultuous history, I realized that she only lived for this long because she was always doing this to survive. Impressive.
  * I love how she held onto the thought of retribution against Judd for years — she played the long game and it had a satisfying end
  * I also like how she does not claim to be the sinless saint that Gilead views her as — she's not self-important, she's honest
* For writing stories, I learned that not all villains have to be the most sympathetic and multidimensional characters. Like Aunt Vidala, Paula, and Commander Judd, some people just plain suck, and that can be ok in a story as long as you don't describe them and their thoughts in-depth. In this way, Atwood wove complexity into characters like Aunt Lydia, by layering villains above her. She seemed bad at first glance, but little did we know that there are worse people.
* <details><summary>Two things I did not like:</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>The teenage crush/romance. Wholly unnecessary and borderline gross.</li>
      <li>The two girls actually being related to each other and to Offred from the first book. Firstly, it was kind of predictable. Secondly, it makes it feel like Gilead is a small place. What's wrong with just creating more characters?</li>
    </ul>
  </details>

## 5. Motifs and Symbols
* The Pearl Girls' character design was unique and evocative, I want to draw fanart in the future lol
* Aunt Lydia's early actions repeated throughout the story — gathering evidence, building loyalties through favours, seeing her actions from other characters' eyes (incriminating documents, the source, blue ink, etc.) — were so satisfying when they finally fall into place later on in the story.

## 6. Themes
* Near the end, Agnes' faith and gratitude in spite of Nicole's pessimism was inspiring; it was the one thing about religion that Gilead didn't distort.
* The love between sisters, mother and child, was powerful. Even Aunt Lydia's heart warmed.
  * The statue inscription at the end brought me to tears. Though the exact facts & details of their lives may be lost to history, and it is impossible to truly verify the historical sources, the reader cannot help but believe in their existence, their success, their love.
* There are political messages in this book that feel ever so applicable today:
  * “those who are not with us are against us.” —Commander Judd
  * I was moved when Aunt Lydia reminded the girls of their vow to protect women and girls. It was such a persuasive argument because it revealed that she believed in some greater good, far greater than what was in Gilead. To have that level of hope in a dystopia was inspiring, and it was the first moment in the story when I began to fully trust her good intentions.
    * Therein lies Judd's mistake — loyalty under threat of death is not loyalty at all.
  * As Atwood has said in an interview, her goal is not to portray Christianity in a negative light, and this book makes that ever clearer. She mentions key passages from the Bible that do not align with Gilead. The very fact that the Bible itself is censored and “the most forbidden of books” should be a strong indicator that Gilead is corrupt.
    * The revelation of the truth was revitalizing, but of course to be expected. The universe abhors untruths as it abhors a vacuum. Truth always prevails.
