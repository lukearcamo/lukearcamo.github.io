★★★★☆ — Werel and Yeowe are two planets with a long, painful history. Three centuries ago, its dark blue ethnic groups began the enslavement of lighter-skinned people. But this complex history is better understood on a smaller, human scale. In these four stories, characters learn about true freedom, heal after the War of Liberation, and understand the place of their local world within the larger universe.

## 1. Worldbuilding

### 1.1. Culture
* Realistic due to clear influences from our own world’s slave trade
* I can also see influences from Hawai’i’s history (plantations, big five oligarchy) – this was my IB extended essay topic so it’s cool to see it here again
* Like on the planet Seggri (another book review coming soon!), Le Guin flips our own world history – the dark-skinned Werelians are the owners and the light-skinned Werelians are the assets.
* Werel is not a monoculture. In fact, the only monocultural aspect is slavery, and that was due to Voe Dean hegemony. Otherwise, there were so many different groups all interacting with each other in complicate ways.
* I should also probably discuss the culture of Hain, eighty light years from Werel and Yeowe, described in A Man of the People.
  * Despite being the center and origin of humanity, it feels like the edge of the universe. The opposite of liminality. The end game. Quiet, idyllic, pastoral, comfortable, simple, small. Reminds me of rural Ontario, or Balicasag island. It’s a hard-to-describe feeling.
  * It feels like a utopia, and in many ways it is, but as Mezha says to Havzhiva, local knowledge is no more or less valuable than universal knowledge. Planets like Werel and Yeowe have much to teach the Hainish as well.
  * I think this utopia, along with its moneyless economy and small-scale cultures, only works because of the low population of Hain. There is low potential for scarcity, for conflict, for overstressing the planet. This is probably also why a social megastructure like the Ekumen can function – it is non-hierarchical, non-ideological, hence it operates consistently over millennia. This distance, this low density of social interaction, is what inhibits tension.

### 1.2. Conlang
* Distinct phonetics/identity from Gethenian languages
* Even if mainly only used for names, I can see Le Guin’s attention to detail by the internal consistency in the affixes of derived terms – Kamye, Rakam, Ratual, Banarkamye, etc.

### 1.3. Technology
Rarely mentioned, but feels realistic and of the same level as our world. Nothing fancy, thus relatable.

## 2. Writing style

### 2.1. Format, Medium, Structure
Four novellas. Nice symmetry, does not drag on.

### 2.2. Imagery, Description, Poetry, Word Choice
* Excellent, as expected from Le Guin. Antiquated feeling, but perfectly comprehensible.
* Good balance between English-derived words (e.g. asset, cutfree) and conlang words (e.g. beza, Arkamye). Unlike most other sci-fi, there is no need to discern and analyze a word’s meaning through context; it’s either intuitive or explained on the pretext of in-universe storytelling.

## 3. Plot
* Grounded, Inspirational, Empowering, Engaging (broad range of pace: parts of action, parts of contemplation)
* As usual, I liked the complicated politics.

## 4. Characters, Dialogue
* Four character studies. Every character had a nuanced and sympathetic perspective, and every character underwent an inspiring process of self-discovery.
  * For example, in Forgiveness Day, it’s interesting to see nuances in how the Ekumen sees Werelians, and how Werelians see the Ekumen. Solly and Teyeo have their flaws, but what’s important is that they are open to learn and grow beyond them.
  * In A Man of the People, I was surprised at how abruptly Havzhiva’s story seemed to end, despite being resolved. I was pleased when the subsequent story, A Woman’s Liberation, filled in the missing gaps.
* I like how the characters were somewhat connected to each others’ stories, even if just a brief reference.

## 5. Motifs/Symbols
There is a satisfying unity when symbols and phrases are repeated and given new meanings e.g. holding fast to the one noble thing, Havzhiva’s weaving background, O O Yeowe, etc.

## 6. Themes
* Slavery, Racism, Class, Women’s rights – In many ways, Werel and Yeowe echo our own world history, but the addition of the Ekumen, the contemporary technology, and the interplanetary setting allows us to see it from a fresh, outsider perspective.
  * I also like how Le Guin takes an intersectional approach to her exploration of these issues. She worldbuilt religious groups (Kamyites vs Tualites), political groups (Voe Deo, Gatay, Bambur, the Hame and the Community, the big five Yeowe corporations, and even the Ekumen), social classes (city people vs rural estates, veots, owners vs assets, bosses and cutfrees, grandmothers), men vs women, etc. The network of conflicts and alliances adds a layer of complexity to an otherwise plain copy of our world.

## 7. Overall
I can confidently say now that Le Guin is my #1 favorite author. Though I love other authors too like Borges, none of them consistently write such perfect worlds like she does.
