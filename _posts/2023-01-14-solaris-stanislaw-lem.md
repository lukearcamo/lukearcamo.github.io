★★★★★ — Kelvin arrives at the station on the planet Solaris, surprised to find it and its two lone inhabitants in disarray. He is a psychologist who will be joining them to study its ocean. Is it alive? Is it real? What does it say? Kelvin is the latest among the line of scientists to ask themselves these questions and fail to answer them, confounded by the ocean's behaviour. As it ebbs and flows into striking forms, some recognizable, others meaningless yet beautiful, Kelvin discovers that he knows as little about the universe as he does about himself.

Note: I would highly recommend the 2011 Bill Johnston translation, since this one is directly from Polish to English and [preserves all the details](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jun/15/first-direct-translation-solaris). The original translation was from Polish to French to English which is kinda bad.

## 1. Themes
Sci-fi is meant to explore the human condition pushed to extremes, and wow Solaris did so:
* The story progresses through several diverse genres like: mystery/horror (i actually got jumpscared by the woman in the hallway lol) > science > romance > tragedy > theology, with philosophy pervading the whole.
* As Snaut says, humanity explores the stars claiming to seek contact, new conversations. But really we seek to better understand ourselves, then when given a mirror we despise it for reflecting our ugliness beside our beauty.
* Could the person in the mirror be considered real or intelligent? What about the mirror itself?
* How do we know that we aren't in a simulation?
* If a copy looks, behaves, and believes itself to be like the original, is it the same as the original?
* How would a mind react to something that has absolutely no meaning? Infinitely less meaning than a rock or a surreal meme?

## 2. Worldbuilding
* The study of Solaris reflects real-world scientific history. There is a commentary on the social effects of great discoveries, the flaws of academia, the media, and the scientific method.
* The ocean was a breath of fresh air from the cliche humanoid aliens of other fictional works. After reading about alien designs like in this book, *Story of Your Life* by Ted Chiang, etc. it's getting harder for me to accept those blue and green humans with wrinkled foreheads. Like in the back of my mind I can always think “we can do better, the universe can get so much more strange than this.” But this is a matter of taste.
* I love how the story focused so much on the humans in the station; their relationships, their mundane daily lives, their sensory experiences, their emotions. This is unlike other sci-fi works which focus on the technology, the aliens, the spaceships, the lasers, etc.

## 3. Writing style
* The 2011 translation by Bill Johnston is superior to the Polish-to-French-to-English translation. I read the first few pages of that one and it was just so clunky.
  * The other one just violates a central rule of translation: preserve the original meaning as much as possible. e.g. how hard is it to just stick to the original Polish person's name? Suppose a character from a French book is named Pierre, why should it be anglicized to Peter in the translation? What does that add?
* Captivating imagery, psychedelic and grand. The translator did an excellent job.
* This was balanced by the scientific exposition — some people understandably find this dry, but it sold the realism and satisfied the scientist in me.
* Making the technology similar to ours demonstrates how focused Lem was in worldbuilding Solaris instead of Earth. And it paid off.
  * From my modern perspective, some aspects were unrealistic, e.g. the entire room dedicated to radio instead of having handheld devices, or the neutrino matter. Nevertheless I can handwave those because this was the 1960s, and again, tech was not the focus of the story—the philosophy was. Intentional or not, a retrofuturistic interstellar humanity is a unique aesthetic.

## 4. Personal interpretations
* To see meaning in the ocean is to see something human in it. This desire of the solaricists is futile and impossible; the universe allows non-human things to exist, and therefore meaningless things to exist.
  * In other words, meaning is inextricably tied to humanness. If something is inhuman, anything that can be ascribed to humans cannot be ascribed to it.
* The theological discussion at the end was unexpected but eye-opening. At a glance it felt like the God he was describing was humanity, or the ocean, or even nihilism, but it wasn't depressing, it just was. Because it was the theory that ascribed the least meaning to the ocean, it felt the most indisputable.
* The sheer unfathomability of the ocean was awe-inspiring. Borges' library expressed similar themes through sheer mathematical scale, but Solaris did this through emotion.
* Even at the end, he had a sense of hope (without the optimistic connotations; anticipation, perhaps?), that there was more to come. But he knew this not because of any kind of optimism, or any kind of evidence comprehended from the ocean. The only thing he comprehended about the ocean's behaviour was that it was endlessly incomprehensible. There is so much more nonsense it has yet to spout. There is so much more nonsense than meaning that can be possibly created in the universe.

    <p>The last night Harey and Kelvin were together, after what Kelvin said, she finally realized or accepted that he truly did love her. At least the original version of her. And because at that point she was aware of how realistic her simulation was, she had no reason to believe that he didn't genuinely love her too. That was the truth, the meaning, that she was searching for. Satisfied, she then did what she did.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When Kelvin refused to stir when she tried to wake him and she gave up, it felt like there was an unsaid goodbye there, for which the letter was an imperfect substitute. This really made me feel some things.</li>
      <li>If a story contains romance, this is how beautiful I want it. I won't settle for anything less.</li>
    </ul>

As much as I'd love to see the ocean animated on the big screen today, this story feels like it would be hard to adapt into a movie — it's too heavily based on internal thoughts.
